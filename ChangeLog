			CHANGES IN OUTBREAKTOOLS 0.1-13
BUG FIXES
	o Minor modifications to documentation to pass new CRAN checks.


			CHANGES IN OUTBREAKTOOLS 0.1-12
NEW FEATURES
	o Modified summary and .inlineSummary functions to handle NAs more effectively.

	o Modified JSON2obkData function to filter out a wider range of missing values
	under different notations (ie. NA, "", "NR") when importing data from JSON format
	and converting to obkData objects.

	o Added .importFromJSON function to allow for automatic retrieval (with
	package RCurl), reformatting (into slots appropriate to obkData class)
	, and conversion of JSON-formatted data from URL addresses to obkData
	objects (with JSON2obkData function).



			CHANGES IN OUTBREAKTOOLS 0.1-1
BUG FIXES
	o examples involving plotting maps commented out to prevent check
	to fail when no internet connection


			CHANGES IN OUTBREAKTOOLS 0.1-0
NEW FEATURES
	o epibase 0.1-2 becomes OutbreakTools 0.1-0 due to a trademark
	infringement.



			CHANGES IN EPIBASE 0.1-2

NEW FEATURES

	o Changed the structure of obkData and obkSequences objects. The
	@samples slot was too contraining and has been replaced with a
	slot @records, storing any time-stamped information at an
	individual level. The @clinical slot has been renamed to @context,
	and is used to store any time-stamped information at a
	populational level (e.g. climatic variables, school closures,
	etc.). okbSequence objects are now storing meta-information on the
	sequences as well.

	o Improvement of various plotting methods; in particular,
	plotIndividualTimeline now allows for visualizing any time-stamped
	information.

	o New accessors for dates and individuals in obkSequences, and for
	dates in obkContacts

	o New procedure as.data.frame for obkContacts

	o New functions make.tip.attributes, make.sequence.attribute,
	make.individual.attributes, returning a wide-format data.frame
	where all information relating to these items is displayed.



			CHANGES IN EPIBASE 0.1-0
